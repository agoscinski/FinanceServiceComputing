\section*{System Structure}
In this section we will talk the structure of our system including its architecture and file structure.

\subsection*{System Architecture}
The system architecture can be seen below.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../diagrams/Component_Diagram_final.pdf}\end{center}

We have a very similar structure on server and client side, because on both sides certain classes are responsible for the same job,
we will explain the general concept of the classes. For example instead of explaining the use of the ServerFIXHandler and the ClientFIXHandler
we will generally discuss the concept of the FIXHandler, since it handles on both sides the same thing.\\
\textbf{FIXHandler:} The FIXHandler is responsible for receiving quickfix messages and packcking them into TradingClass objects 
we then can use in the ServerLogic for processing. Furthermore it also does the reverse job and transforms TradingClass objects into
and quickfix messages which then can be send. It also managas the tags of the quickfix configuration file. \\
\textbf{FIXApplication:} The FIXApplication is invoked when a quickfix message is send or received. \\
\textbf{Logic:} The Logic works as a bridge between all elements. It processes messages translated from the FIXHandler, checks the 
requirements for messages and invokes the to necessary database requests. It is the first object which is startad and it starts every other object. \\
\textbf{DatabaseHandler:} The DatabaseHandler works as an interface from python to MySQL database, so MySQL commands can be executeded through
the Logic. It offers functions for the Logic to create the database, and insert, update or select data from the database. \\
\textbf{GUIHandler:} The GUIHandler offers functions to control the GUI elements, it is mainly used for console input handling and to swap more
logical GUI handling from the GUISignal to the GUIHandler. \\
\textbf{GUISignal:} The GUISignal is invoked when a user interaction with a GUI happens. For example if a button or a key is pushed. \\

Here an example how our server file is structured. You can see a automatic generated UML diagram with pyreverse. Sadly
the types are mostly not recognized, even though we documented almost everything

\subsection*{File Structure}
Here we will explain how we structured our file system.
\textbf{TradingClass.py} This files contains all logical objects for the Logic and the DatabaseHandler as well as enums for database and fix
related tasks. It also contains the DatabaseHandler parent class including functions parsing sql files. \\
\textbf{server.py} This files contains all server related classes \\
\textbf{client.py} This files contains all client related class \\
\textbf{matching\_algorithm.py} This files contains functions related to the matching algorithm \\
\textbf{utils.py} This files contains config file class which creates and handles quickfix config file \\
\textbf{test\_FILENAME} A testing file for the file with the name FILENAME. \\

\subsubsection*{Database folder} 
The folder contains the database MySQL workbench files as well as their documentation. Furthermore each client and the server has
a folder with its name. Each of these folders has init\_database.sql file which is used for the parser to now which files should be
executed. Additionally, there exist a mysql\_init\_server\_database.sql which can be used to create the database with MySQL without
needing to start the python files.

\subsubsection*{GUI folder}

\section*{Key Techniques}

The project is mainly written in python. We used python 2.7. For some features like the matching algorithm the numpy library \cite{numpy} was used.
For the FIX communication we used the quickfix library. For the database we use MySQL and use the library MySQL-python as interface between python and MySQL.
As documentation standard for python we used pep-0008.
\subsection*{Order Matching}

%TODO Valentin
\subsection*{FIX}
QuickFIX library is an Open Source FIX engine library, it support several programming language C++,Python,Ruby,Java and .NET. 
In the current project, we use QuickFIX library version 1.14.3 (current latest version). QuickFix provide throughout fix message definition for every message which can be configured for each the project.
It also support mandatory field checking for each type of message.
\subsection*{Database}

For the database MySQL 5.7.15 was used. We created the diagrams and sql scripts creating the structure of the database with MySQL Workbench.
As interface between python any MySQL we used MySQL-python version 1.2.5.

\section*{Conclusion}
The usage of the quickfix library with pythos is recommended because the port is not fitted to python code. It is mostly Java code with python grabbers.
